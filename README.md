# stanleycupbot
I developed a bot to automate the purchase of Stanley cups during periods of high demand. To achieve this, I used a combination of web scraping and automation techniques. The bot was programmed to monitor the Stanley cup listings on popular retail websites, checking for restocks in real-time. Once a restock was detected, the bot would automatically add the desired quantity of cups to the shopping cart and proceed through the checkout process. I integrated a payment API to ensure swift transactions, minimizing the risk of missing out due to high traffic or manual delays. This automated approach allowed me to purchase multiple Stanley cups at retail prices and resell them at a premium when they quickly sold out, capitalizing on the market's high demand and limited supply.
